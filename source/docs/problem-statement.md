### Problem Description

The office at DUCS has been always managing a major part of their work on paper, which means a  umber of registers and the workload to manage them.  Remarks or instructions on any official document are passed verbally. Searching for a specific entry consumes time and there is very little margin for error rectification. The office also collects data from teachers ourside DUCS but employed at DU. Even when information is aggregated online or uploaded as files, it is stored on shared resources, which are decided as requied. Naturally this means that different people then end up using different resources for the same task. For eg, to collect data from teachers on the courses that they teach, forms are created and overseed by an individual person. They are stored on their work space and shared as needed. The office along with the faculty also receives and manages forms received from research scholars on their academic __, tracks and forwards status on their requests on leaves, seminars and courseworks and maintains a record on their admission details. The tasks pertaining to the scholar could be moved to their own responsibility under the guidance and invovlement of their mentors.  To solve all of the above problems, the department needed an automated, centralised platform to shift their work and divide responsibility between all parties involved.
