<h2>Letter</h2>

<ul>
<li><h3>Problem</h3>

<p>Each Outgoing letter has a unique serial number which depends on its type. Type of the letter can be <code>Bill</code>, <code>General</code> or <code>Notesheet</code>. Serial number of an outgoing letter has following format :-</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th align="center">Type of letter</th>
  <th align="center">Serial Number Format</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td align="center">Bill</td>
  <td align="center">CS/TR/YYYY/XXXX</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="center">General</td>
  <td align="center">CS/YYYY/XXXX</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="center">Notesheet</td>
  <td align="center">CS/NTS/YYYY/XXXX</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>where <code>YYYY</code> is the year in which the letter was sent and <code>XXXX</code> are the total number of letters of corresponding type sent before that letter in that year plus one.</p>

<p>Similar to outgoing letters, incoming letters also has unique serial number with format:-</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CS/D/YYYY/XXXX</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where 'YYYY' is the year in which the incoming letter was received and XXXX are the total number of incoming letters received before that letter in that year plus one.</p></li>
<li><h3>Solutions</h3>

<p>This problem has many solutions some of which are listed below.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Accept the serial number from user. At the backend we can validate the format and uniqueness of the serial number.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pros

<ol>
<li>Easy to implement.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Cons

<ol>
<li>Though we can check the uniqueness of serial number but implemting the logic for validating that value of <code>XXXX</code> is actually correct is quite complex. Either we can internally count the total number of letters sent before in that year every time user create, edit or delete a letter and check serial number of all letters sent in that year and accordingly ask user to update serial number of all other letters or we can assume that user always enter correct serial number.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Auto generate serial number whenever a new letter is created or type or date of letter is updated.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pros

<ol>
<li>User will not add serial number(user friendly).</li>
<li>Serial number of all letters are always correct.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Cons

<ol>
<li>Complex to implement. We will need to store latest value of <code>XXXX</code> corresponding to every year and type of letter.</li>
<li>Whenever user delete or edit type or date of letter serial number of other letters and latest value of <code>XXXX</code> needs to be updated accordingly.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li><h3>What we implement</h3>

<p>Assuming frequency of deletion of letters is negligible and user always enter record in order in which letter is received or sent we choose to auto generate serial number. We stored latest value of <code>XXXX</code> corresponding to every year and type of letter in cache. On creation of letter, value of <code>XXXX</code> of corresponding year and type incrmented and serial number of that letter is assigned  with the value of <code>XXXX</code> accordingly. Once letter is created type of outgoing letter is not editable.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pros

<ol>
<li>User friendly.</li>
<li>Easy to implement.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Cons

<ol>
<li>Whenever year of date of letter is edited or letter is deleted their corresponding serial number can't be reassigned to another letter.</li>
<li>value of <code>XXXX</code> depends on order in which letter record is entered.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Teacher</h2>

<ul>
<li><h3>Problem</h3>

<p>Office staff collect teaching details of all DU college teachers teaching CS every 6 months. Teachers fill their teaching details after receiving notification and submit them before deadline. Also some teachers and Department faculties are assigned as supervisors. Supervisors has their publications and can view their scholar's profile.</p></li>
<li><h3>Solution</h3>

<p>One of the possible solution is to create different guard ans migration for teachers login similar to users login. Teachers can be given  their credentials so they can login in the portal and notified for filling teaching details. They can fill and submit their teaching details via portal. Also <code>supervisor_profile</code> migration can be created to store supervisor information. Each entry in <code>supervisor_profile</code> belong to either department faculty i.e. <code>users</code> table or <code>teachers</code> table. Publications and Scholars of supervisor belongs to <code>supervisor_profile</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pros

<ol>
<li>Teacher can't interfer in department work i.e. roles and permissions can't be assigned to them</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Cons

<ol>
<li>Number of migrations increases.</li>
<li>Chaining for supervisor profile access... $teacher->supervisorProfile->scholars (?)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><h3>What we implement</h3>

<p>Instead of creating different migration and guard for teachers,  a new category <code>Teacher</code> is introduced in <code>users</code> table. Teachers details can be added in <code>users</code> table by selecting <code>Teacher</code> category. Teachers will have same login as department faculty. Also boolean attribute <code>is_supervisor</code> added in <code>users</code> table which is set to false by default and its value is true if user is supervisor. Publications and scholars of supervisor will belongs to <code>users</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pros

<ol>
<li>Simple and easy to implement.</li>
<li>No new migrations are created.</li>
<li>No chaining for supervisor profile access (?)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Cons

<ol>
<li><code>users</code> migration size increases.</li>
<li>Accidently, roles and permissions which are designed for department members can be assigned to teachers.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Scholar Advisors</h2>

<ul>
<li><h3>Problem</h3>

<p>Department may assign cosupervisor to scholar. Cosupervisor can be department faculty, DU college teacher or external. Advisory committee is assigned to Scholar which consist of scholar's supervisor, cosupervisor (if any) and other members. Other members of advisory committe of the scholar can be cosupervisors, externals and department faculties which are not supervisors. Problem is how to store department cosupervisors and other members of scholar's advisory committee.</p></li>
<li><h3>Solutions</h3>

<p>Some of the possible solutions are listed below</p>

<ol>
<li>Make separate migration for cosupervisors in which each entry either refers to <code>users</code> table if cosupervisor is department faculty or DU college teacher, or store cosupervisors details if cosupervisor is external. Then foreign key for scholar's cosupervisor can be created in <code>scholars</code> table which refers to the cosuprvisor table. To store other members of advisory committee of scholar other migration <code>advisor_scholar</code> can be created. Relation between <code>scholars</code> and <code>advisor_scholar</code> would be one to many. Each entry in <code>advisor_scholar</code> either would be referring to <code>users</code> table (if member is department faculty), cosupervisors table (if member is cosupervisor) or storing member's detail (if member is external).</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Cons

<ol>
<li>Complex in implementation. Many migrations with morphs relation are created.</li>
<li>Details of external members of scholar advisory committee is duplicated if they are advisors of more than one scholar.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<ol start="2">
<li>Details of other members of advisory committee who are externals can be stored in separate migration <code>externals</code>. Similar to above solution make separate migration for cosupervisors and other members of advisory committee of scholar. Only difference is now each entry in <code>advisor_scholar</code>  would be referring to <code>users</code> table (if member is department faculty), cosupervisors table (if member is cosupervisor) or <code>externals</code> (if member is external).</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Pros

<ol>
<li>For each external member of advisory committee unique entry is created. There is no duplication of details of external members of scholar advisory committee if they are advisors of more than one shcolar.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Cons

<ol>
<li>Complex in implementation. Many migrations with morphs relation are created.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><h3>What we implement</h3>

<p>Since all department faculty members and DU college teachers are stored in <code>users</code> table, one more boolean attribute in the table <code>is_cosupervisor</code> is added which is set to false by default and true if user is cosupervisor. One more category is added in <code>users</code> table name <code>External</code>. All details of externals are stored in <code>users</code> table. These externals can be cosupervisors or external member of advisory committee. New migration <code>advisor_scholar</code> for storing other members of  scholar advisory committee is created. <code>advisor_scholar</code> has many to one relation with <code>scholars</code> table and refer to <code>users</code> table for other member.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pros

<ol>
<li>Easy to implement and understand.</li>
<li>For each external (whether cosupervisor or advisory committee member) only one entry is created.</li>
<li>No new migration for cosupervisors and externals are created.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Cons

<ol>
<li>Size of <code>users</code> table increases.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Trade-offs</h2>

<ol>
<li>Supervisor, Cosupervisor and Advisory Committee of a Scholar</li>
</ol>

<p>A PhD scholar has a research committee consisting of 3-4 members
1. A supervisor - a faculty at DUCS or CS teachers at the UG-colleges.
2. A cosupervisor - a faculty, or a UG-teacher or an external(person not employed/ affiliated to DU at any post). A scholar may/may not have cosupervisor at a point. 
3. An external - as stated above
4. A faculty teacher</p>

<p>The supervisor and cosupervisor can only be set by the office, while the other members of the research committee are set by the scholar's supervisor. 
Moreover, any of these members can be replaced by the same authority as above. Once replaced, the constituent members need to be recorded with their tenure. An update took place in the current one, while replacement meant creating a record of the entry with the term duration.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: A replacement of a cosupervisor/ supervisor also means creation of an entry in old_advisory_committtees.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For eg:
If the research committee of a scholar consisted of - Supervisor 'A', Cosupervisor 'B' and external 'C'</p>

<p>Supervisor 'A': 2019 - present
Co-supervisor 'B': 2019 - present
Advisory Committee - (A, B , C): 2019-present</p>

<p>when 'A' is replaced by 'E', it would require a record of two groups.</p>

<p>Supervisor 'A': 2019 - 2020
Advisory Committee - (A, B , C): 2019 - 2020</p>

<p>and the update will be like so:</p>

<p>Supervisor 'E': 2020 - present
Co-supervisor 'B': 2019 - present
Advisory Committee - (E, B , C): 2020 - present</p>

<p>At first, we made two json column in the scholars table to store the records of advisory committees, supervisors and cosupervisors. A supervisor was morph to either users or teachers. A cosupervisor was foreign to a cosupervisors table whose entries included duplicated data from users or teachers and any external member created.</p>

<p>Problems with this approach were:
1. We were constrained on what details we needed to record, because we were making a copy of them. We went with name, email designation and affiliation only.
2. Creating copies of data meant no updates could be tracked in the future.
3. Having json columns for keeping records of supervisor, cosupervisor and advisory committee made the scholars table bloated and the method didn't seem natural.
4. Cosupervisors contained data copied from the current users and teachers. Also, an external could be a cosupervisor or an external could also be the member of an advisory committee. In both, they were being created as used. Sepearting them didn't seem like a good choice.
5. The externals being created in the advisory committee of a scholar were not being stored somewhere such that they could be used anywhere else as well. The external was just being stored with its details in the current scholar only.
6. When a supervisor was replaced, two copies of its record were being created. One to record previous supervisors, and one for previous advisory committee. (because the replacement of even a single member meant the advisory committee getting replaced)
7. We needed to filter lists when we needed to send only cosupervisors, faculty teachers who were not cosupervisors and supervisors.</p>

<p>To solve some of the above problems we decided merge the teachers and users table in the users table and use a boolean value to indicate if they were a supervisor or cosupervisor,
and create an externals tables as well to add any external members, marking the ones that are cosupervisors. We removed the cosupervisors table at this point.</p>

<p>Since all the advisors existed in a tabl,, json columns could be replaced with tables to track these advisors of a scholar. Even the current supervisor and cosupervisor were added to these tables.</p>

<p>Now, a scholar had advisors from users and externals. The only problem here was that externals were being maintained in a seperate table which meant that any expansion pf abilities in future for advisors would require us to add those abilities to both the types.</p>

<p>We then decided to also create externals in the user table without giving them login access.</p>

<p>This meant that on adding members to advisory committee the user would only search for the member to be added, and create an external on the fly if needed. We gave away with showing filtered lists for existing cosupervisors, or faculty teachers because these lists could get lengthy and searching for a user that you want to add seemed more natural.</p>

<p>We also decided to create a table for advisors only, since supervisor and cosupervisors are contained within, and calculate there tenure from that information. This method might have become confusing for future and also requierd for us to maintain another field to find out which user was a scholar's cosupervisor out of all advisor (the advisory community could have a cosupervisor as a member of a scholar's advisors).</p>

<p>Finally, we created  scholar_cosupervisors, scholar_supervisors and scholar_advisors pivot tables between scholars and users to keep track of all three along with their duration.</p>

<p>These tables also contained the current ones hance removing this information from scholars table entirely.</p>

<p>Replacement of an advisory committee as an effect of replacement of supervisor or cosupervisor would not be duplicated for information. Instead we use their individual duration to calculate when they would have been part of and which advisory committee.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>Storing conferences and journals in the same table</li>

<p>Research scholars have two kinds of publications - journals and conferences.</p>

<p>Both these types had more common attributes than uncommon. Journals have a publisher and a number whereas a conference has a city and country. Except for these difference rest everything was same. Creating different tables to just come around two attributes did not seem like a good idea. Moreover, both of these belonged to the same type - publications. 
Also, each publication can have a presentation. Creating two different tables would have required us to create a morph type in presentations to find the associated publications, which although achievable, was a bit against the idea that a publication had a presentation - whether it was a journal or conference di not make a difference.</p>

<p>Therefore, along with a common table we also made common controllers and view for both kinds. Writing validation rules based on the type that the user wanted to create.</p>

<li>Making seperate tables for Phd-Seminar, Title Approval ans examiner even though there's a 1-1 relationship between them and a scholar.</li>
</ol>

<p>We first started by making a common table for Phd-Seminar and Title Approval. Both of them required a field for the requests's status. Phd Seminar also required a date on which it was scheduled.</p>

<p>The problem with this approach was:
1. We had to share the type of request it was
2. A scholar can make only a single request of each kind. We had to use first() on each request which was not clear enough about this very fact.
3. date column was being left empty when it was a title approval request. 
4. Both kinds have different requirements for application. The common policy file had to contain different methods of authorization for them.</p>

<p>Similarly for examiners, the table contained entirely different data. A status and two date columns for approval and recommendation. Also, this was being added by a supervisor. This also meant keeping functions based on  authorization on different kind of users in the same file.</p>

<p>Keeping the three of them in a single table meant leaving columns blank here and there depending on the type of the request. 
Keeping a common table would have been benficial if there were less differences and the table could be made generic for future requests. Here it did not seem like so. Hence, we created seperate table for all of the.</p>
